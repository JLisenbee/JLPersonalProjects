## What is this?

* This is a dice roller using the Rust language.
* It takes in an input of dice in the format XdY where X is the number of dice you wish to roll, and Y is the number of sides on each of those dice.
* It parses the input string, displays the numbers you rolled, and 
* It was first constructed November 17, 2023, and It's been considered completed since December 15th, 2023.
* I built it to try out Rust, and practice some text parsing skills.

## How do I use this?
* If I did everything correctly, those on windows can simply run the executable.
* Those on mac/linux, I'm still unsure of how to cross compile for you. However, if you happen to have the rust compiler on your machine already, you should be able to just execute '''cargo run''' from a console in this directory.
