# What is this?

This is a minecraft mod I made a long time ago for minecart version 1.5.2. It adds fully custom block that self replicates at random intervals and is extremely hard to destroy. I borrowed a lot of grass block spreading code from the vanilla game, and repurposed it to make this.

# How do i use it?

* If you can dredge up a way to install the Forge Mod Loader for Java Minecraft version 1.5.2, do that first (apparently I made a youtube video on how to do this? It's in the readme in the zip file itself, thouhg it's incredibly cringy and borderline unwatchable. I'm sure there's a better way.)
* Run your modded minecraft with Forge installed to have it generate the necessary files.
* Close minecraft.
* Drop the entire zip folder into the mods folder in your minecraft install's parent directory. (you can get there on windows by using %appdata% -> .minecraft -> mods)
* Run minecraft
* Open a world, preferably in creative, and place a single block of the stuff. In about 2-3 mins, it should start working.
