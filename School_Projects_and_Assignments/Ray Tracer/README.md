# What is this?

This is a ray tracer constructed from scratch. It takes any files in the rayshade file format and turns them into ppm files.

# How to run this

Currently, you have to do some hard coding in Visual Studio to get it to work, and it currently relies on some CMake dependencies on my own machine.

You can do some banging around on your own to make it work but right now it's a WIP to get it standalone. 

In the meantime, the code is fully visible to browse, and i've included some sample rayshade files in the "/data/" directory that the program is guaranteed to work with, as well as sample outputs in the main directory (the same one this readme is in). You may need the gimp photo editor as the ppm file format is relatively primative and esoteric (but very easy to make!).
